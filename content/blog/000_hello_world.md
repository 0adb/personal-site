This is my first blog post. This is primarily a placeholder while I work on actual content, but I'll take the time here to declare my intent for these blogs:

* I'd like them to be semi-professional, or at least to be comfortable sharing these blogs with, say, a prospective recruiter.

* I'd like these to skew a bit technical in focus. Specifically my initial idea for these blogs is to write code for fun, then, if I feel like it, talk about it on these blogs.


This is all I've come up with currently. Here's to hoping that this isn't my last post.

Subtitle is a reference to a book title that I enjoy, called  _Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret_, by Judy Blume. I haven't read the book, but I find the title neat.
